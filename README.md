# CS50-Project-1
This is what I created for Problem Set 0 of CS50, Introduction to Computer Science. It is a game called Mmm, Donut that was created on scratch.

# Mmm, Donut
How the game works:
  - Use your arrow keys to control the car
  - Dodge the dinosaurs and octopi, letting them move towards the red line which will result in +1 and +2 points respectively
  - Maneuver around obstacles to touch the donut, resulting in +5 points.
  - Touching the animals results in loss in score (-1 dinosaur, -2 octopus) and -1 for lives.
  - Achieve the highest score possible prior to losing all lives.
